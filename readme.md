# Security.JS

Security utilities for Node.js and the Browser.

## Goals

- [ ] User session management with CSRF tokens
- [ ] CORS
- [ ] Oauth2 client application grants
- [ ] Oauth2 server
- [ ] Oauth2 browser / user authentication
- [ ] PKCE on top of the Oauth2
- [ ] Secure random hash generation

Essentially, everything you'd need to implement robust authentication in your app without paying for it like with Okta or Auth0.
